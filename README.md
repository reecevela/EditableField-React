# EditableField-React
This is a React Component I just built that lets you click on an Edit icon to edit text, then submit it when you either press enter while focused or click a submit checkbox.

NPM Dependencies:
- React
- @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
- @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
- uniqid
